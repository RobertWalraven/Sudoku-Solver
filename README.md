# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku assistance program for Windows

This is a tool I built to help me with solving Sudoku 9x9 and 16x16 puzzles.   It uses 11 different rules that humans typically use to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Possibilities can be turned on to help you see what numbers are valid for each cell, and you can ask for hints each step of the way if you are stuck.
